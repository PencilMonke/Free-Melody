<div class="right-column-layout">
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be
     wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">

        <!-- If you want to make your link look like a button, add class="button" to your 'a' tag like so: -->
        <a href="comic/001/#comic-page">
		<img src="your_content/images/navigation_icons/Icon_First.png">
			</a>
        <a href="latest/#comic-page">
		<img src = "your_content/images/navigation_icons/Icon_Latest.png">
			</a>
    </div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->
