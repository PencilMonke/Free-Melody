    Anything in brackets that start with an exclamation mark, like this, is called a comment! It will not affect the HTML
    of your page. It's just a note from me to you!
    There's a little extra HTML I've added here to jazz up the front page, but you don't need it! If you just want basic
    HTML with p tags and h1 tags and such, that will also work just fine.

<!-- The front page uses a responsive 2-column layout. This is done by first defining what content is going to be in
     the column layout, like so. -->
<div class="right-column-layout">
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be
     wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pencilmonke/">
            <img src="your_content/images/logo.png">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="right-column">
	<h1>The Influence Institute of Science and Technology...</h1>
 
        <p>One of the most prestigious colleges in the world, and more importantly, the leading research institution on Implant-Based Cybernetics. And Ophelia, as many students there do, is studying to be a part of the team that finally cracks the code and makes these cybernetics possible, which would change the world.</p>

        <p>But when the disappearance of a friend leads her to uncover a dark government secret that no one else seems to know or care about, she is forced to choose; Go searching for her friend, or focus on changing the world.</p>


        <!-- If you want to make your link look like a button, add class="button" to your 'a' tag like so: -->
        <a href="comic/001/#comic-page">
		<img src="your_content/images/navigation_icons/Icon_First.png">
			</a>
        <a href="latest/#comic-page">
		<img src = "your_content/images/navigation_icons/Icon_Latest.png">
			</a>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->
