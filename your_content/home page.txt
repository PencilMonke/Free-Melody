    Anything in brackets that start with an exclamation mark, like this, is called a comment! It will not affect the HTML
    of your page. It's just a note from me to you!
    There's a little extra HTML I've added here to jazz up the front page, but you don't need it! If you just want basic
    HTML with p tags and h1 tags and such, that will also work just fine.

<!-- The front page uses a responsive 2-column layout. This is done by first defining what content is going to be in
     the column layout, like so. -->
<div class="right-column-layout">
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be
     wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pencilmonke/">
            <img src="your_content/images/logo.png"

        <p>But that never mattered to Ophelia. When everyone told her it was impossible, she didn't believe them. Through sheer determination and smarts alone, she forced her way into acceptance. Now that she's there, she's got her mind set on becoming the first to crack the code on real cybernetics.</p>

        <p>At least, that would be the story, in a perfect world. But this ins't a perfect world.</p>

        <!-- If you want to make your link look like a button, add class="button" to your 'a' tag like so: -->
        <a class="button" href="comic/001/#comic-page">First Page</a>
        <a class="button" href="latest/#comic-page">Latest Page</a>

        <!--
        If you want to set some information apart, you can set the class as "infobox"! That will put your content in a
        different block of color, which can be defined in stylesheet.css.
        -->
        <p class="infobox">(You will need to manually update the link to your first comic page yourself, but the
            <code>latest</code> page will always point to your newest comic!)</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->
